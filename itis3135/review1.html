            <ul>
                <li>The submission link has a path to get to the client project page</li>
                <li>The scripts file begins with a capital S and the style sheet uses camel case. On the plus side there are no spaces in any file or folder names.</li>
                <li>The site has a very impressive design and follows all of the C.R.A.P. principals very well. The only design issue I can see is that sometimes the nav bar and footer will overlap the main content of the page.</li>
                <li>This site does have a main and footer but it is missing a header.</li>
                <li>The site does not have an h1 in the header to serve as a site/brand header.</li>
                <li>The main does always have a title but tends to use h3's and h1's. Personally I think it looks quite good this way.</li>
                <li>There is no link or slogan relating to the creator's brand.</li>
                <li>The page has a good and consistenet footer with the designed by tag. It does not have the validations but I believe those are not required for this project.</li>
                <li>Overall there are some requirements missing but the design of the website is very impressive and describes the client and the client's company Azure Network Security very well.</li>
