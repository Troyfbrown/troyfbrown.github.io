                <h3><a href="https://www.monographcomms.ca">Monograph Communications</a></h3>
                <p>This is the homepage for the Monograph Communications website. This page tells the user brief bits about the company and shows how to get to more depth information on various topics</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Contrast:</span> This website uses excellent contrast in using dark balck text over a light pink/purple hue displayed in the background. It also contrasts the large important headers with the smaller descriptive text, excellently calling the user's eye to the correct places on the screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Repetition:</span> This website uses the exact same dividing lines to separate sections of information throughout the page. Another source of good repetition is that the buttons all look the same with the same arrow graphic on each one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Alignment:</span> Within the separated sections, all of the similar big headings and messages are inline with each other aside from the intentionally different quote. Similar to the quote, any special graphic or design elements within the page stay neatly within their lined off sections and help the page to flow effortlessly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">proximity:</span> This page keeps the large title and company slogan at a farther distance from the rest of the text. Aside from the first sectioned off block being larger to illustrate importance, all of the blocks are the same size and space. The text is spaced well and sometimes small tags are added to make the website look good without awkward blank space.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="http://theroommovie.com">The Room - Official Movie Site</a></h3>
                <p>This is an official promotional website for the movie <em>The Room</em>. It holds links to trailers, show dates, and much more.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Contrast:</span> The most immediately noticeable use of poor contrast is the darkly colored navbar text on the black background. As well as inrcredibly inconsistent sizing of text which, if contrasted better would make for better understanding of the website flow
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Repetition:</span> This page is incredibly inconsistent with where it places its images and text spacing. It also constantly changes the text color from red to white in no visible pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Alignment:</span> The alignment is potentially the worst part of this page. The website runs as one continues stream of text and images and is the definition of visual vomit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">proximity:</span> The proximity is inconsistent at best for this page. Most lines of text have different spacing between the lines above them and the lines below them and images are sometimes placed in line right next to text.
                    </li>
