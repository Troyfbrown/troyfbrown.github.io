                <li><span class="bold">Personal Background:</span> I was born and raised in Wake Forest, NC. Outside of school I enjoy going to the beach, taking nature walks, and playing different musical instruments. I moved to Charlotte 3 years ago for school. I recently took a semester off to work and follow some of my musical passions.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Professional Background:</span> I worked as a lifeguard for 2 years in high school as well as a year of fast food service. This past semester I worked as a valet for the Renaissance Hotel in Raleigh.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Academic Background:</span> After graduating high school in 2020 I began my higher education at UNCC. After 2.5 years I took a semester long break and am now back to earning my degree.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Background</span> in this Subject: My only background in this subject was taking a Software Engineering class in my sophomore year which utilized HTML, CSS, and Python/Flask.</li>

                <li><span class="bold">Courses I'm taking and why:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="bold">ITCS3160 - Database Design and Implementation:</span> Not only is it a part of my major, I am taking this course to become more familiar with the use of SQL.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">MATH2164 - Matrices & Linear Algebra:</span> I am taking this class because it is the last math course required in my major.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">LBST1105 - Arts & Society: Visual Art:</span> This course is the last of my required elective credits.</li>
                        <li><span class="bold">ITIS3135 - Web App Design and Development:</span> This course is in my concentration and seems like a good way to get better at more real world application of coding.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</span>  I play 4 different instruments.</li>
