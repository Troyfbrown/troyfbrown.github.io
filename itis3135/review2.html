            <ul>
                <li>The submission link goes to the correct page.</li>
                <li>All of the file names are lowercase and do not have spaces.</li>
                <li>The sizing makes things easy to read and the colors and fonts use the appropriate standard CSS file. The contrast, repetition, and alignment are all good. I like the pink white black and most pages look similar. The only issue is with the proximity of the figcaption in the about page. It should just be closer to the picture instead of the paragraph below it.</li>
                <li>The page contains an appropriate header, main, and footer.</li>
                <li>The page does have a good h1 in the header containing the title.</li>
                <li>The main always starts with an h2 of the specific page's name.</li>
                <li>The page does not have a brand tagline. Though for this specific project I think the "designed by" section in the footer is plenty.</li>
                <li>The page has a good and consistenet footer with the designed by tag. It does not have the validations but I believe those are not required for this project.</li>
                <li>The project has the required amount of pages, good design, functioning html, and describes Project PinkBag to the user quite well.</li>
