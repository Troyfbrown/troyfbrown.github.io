            <p>Most people are familiar marching band in a high school or college setting. However, the marching band I participate in is a competitve, top of the line, international circuit, known as Drum Corps International (DCI).

            <h2>About Bass Drums</h2>
            <p>Bass drums are the big sideways drums that you always see out on the marching band field (pictured below). They range from sizes of 16" in diameter to 32" in diameter each creating different pitches that get lower as the size increases.</p>
            <p>The bass drum is played with a pair of mallets typically by 5-6 individuals. When all the individuals play in unison, they had the typical "bass" sound that we associate with music. But when playing independently, due to their variety of tones, they are melodic in nature. With each of the 5-6 individuals contributing one pitch that when put together with the others creates a melody.</p>

            <h2>Why I Enjoy This</h2>
            <p>I enjoy this because it is an activity in which I get to be highly competitive while still making lasting memories with freinds who care about music as much as I do. Being able to work really hard on something with a group of people and then showcase that product to thousands is an amazing experience.</p>

            <h2>Biggest Bass Drum Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>This past summer I was a part of an ensemble called the Cavaliers and we placed 8th in world championships. While that was exciting, the real excitement came from our percussion section, which being a drummer I was a part of, winning first place. This prestigous award is known as the Fred Sanford High Percussion Award and I can be seen holidng it in the picture below.</p>
            <p>My other proud accomplishment happens this weekend (11/10-11/11) my percussion section from the summer will be performing at PASIC. PASIC stands for Percussive Arts Society International Convenetion and is the largest drumming convention in America, possibly the world.</p>

            <h2>Other drumming</h2>
            <p>Outside of Bass drumming I like to play drumset in my free time. Although I have not had as much time to focus my time towards it like I have had to do for my competitive drumming.</p>
            <p>Once I become too old to participate in competitive marching band (22 years old) I plan on taking up the marimba a well. I want to due this in order to pursue a more melodic, as opposed to rhythmic, form of percussion.</p>
